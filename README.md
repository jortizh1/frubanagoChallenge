We have a catalog in a Json file with all varieties of Fruits and Vegetables (products.json)

• Run a small REST service enabling an endpoint "/ products".
Where all items will be sorted by name or by weight (weight)

• Enable another endpoint to our REST service: "/ orders" where you can select by Route, by Order ("orderID"), by quantity of products to be delivered, by order total (amount x price of the product).
